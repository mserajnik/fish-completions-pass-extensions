> fish completions for pass extensions

This repository contains fish completions for the following [pass][pass]
password manager extensions:

- [pass-ln][pass-ln]
- [pass-otp][pass-otp]

## Install

The easiest way to install the completions is to use the [Fisher][fisher]
plugin manager:

```fish
fisher install mserajnik/fish-completions-pass-extensions
```

To manually install instead, copy
[`completions/pass.fish`](completions/pass.fish) into your
`~/.config/fish/completions` directory.

## Caveats

Due to how completions for pass are implemented, it is currently not possible
to cleanly add completions for extensions without sourcing the main pass
completions. This is done with a semi-dynamic approach by checking common
locations. If your pass completions are not in one of those locations, it will
not work.
