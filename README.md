> fish completions for pass-otp

This repository contains fish completions for [pass-otp][pass-otp], an
extension for the [pass][pass] password manager.

## Install

The easiest way to install the completions is to use the [Fisher][fisher]
plugin manager:

```fish
fisher install mserajnik/fish-completions-pass-otp
```

To manually install instead, copy
[`completions/pass.fish`](completions/pass.fish) into your
`~/.config/fish/completions/` directory.

## Caveats

Due to how completions for pass are implemented, it is currently not possible
to cleanly add completions for pass-otp without sourcing the main pass
completions. This is done with a semi-dynamic approach by checking common
locations. If your pass completions are not in one of those locations, it will
not work.
